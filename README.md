If you're a JavaScript developer, you already know that working with data is a big deal. 

Why let the Python and R coders get all the glory? JavaScript isn't just good at data visualization, you can move your entire data wrangling pipeline to JavaScript and work more effectively. 

[Data Wrangling with JavaScript](http://bit.ly/2t2cJu2) teaches you core data munging techniques in JavaScript, along with many libraries and tools that will make your data tasks even easier.

This repository contains code examples for Chapter 2 (*Getting started with Node.js*) of [Data Wrangling with JavaScript](http://bit.ly/2t2cJu2).

Here you'll find simple examples of Node.js command line applications and Node.js web servers.
